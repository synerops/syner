# Syner OS

## What is Syner OS?

Syner OS is an Agentic Operating System that implements the [OS Protocol](https://github.com/synerops/protocol) specification. It provides a runtime environment where AI agents can operate with identity, skills, and structured workflows.

The OS enables agents to follow a disciplined loop: gather context, execute actions, validate with checks, and repeat. This pattern ensures predictable, auditable agent behavior.
