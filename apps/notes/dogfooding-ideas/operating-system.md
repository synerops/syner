how to use obsidian/syner.md + claude code to build a 24/7 personal operating system and build your startup:

1. write everything in markdown (daily notes, projects, beliefs, people, meetings)

2. link your notes together so they mirror how your brain actually thinks.

3. install obsidian cli/syner.md mcp/cli so claude code can read your entire vault + the relationships.

4. stop reexplaining projects every session. use reference files instead.

5. build custom slash commands:

/context → load your full life + work state
/trace → see how an idea evolved over months
/connect → bridge two domains you’ve been circling
/ideas → generate startup ideas from your vault
/graduate → promote daily thoughts into real assets

6. keep a strict rule: human writes the vault. agents read it, suggest, execute.

7. let claude aka clode surface patterns you’ve been unconsciously circling for years.

8. delegate from inside your notes. one sentence in obsidian/syner.md → agent handles the rest.

9. treat writing as leverage.the more you write, the more context your agents have.

10. understand this:markdown files are the oxygen of llms.
