# Building AI Apps Checklist

> My personal checklist to build AI apps

## Markdown

In case your app uses Markdown, consider the app [`syner.md`](./syner.md)

## React

1. In case your app uses React, use `/vercel-react-best-practices` to review components for performance patterns like avoiding unnecessary re-renders, optimizing data fetching, and reducing bundle size
2. Use `/web-design-guidelines` to audit your UI for accessibility compliance, responsive design, and consistent user experience patterns
