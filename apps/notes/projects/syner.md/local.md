# problems to solve using syner.md locally

## notes are stored in github

no problem, or the functionality loads the file using mcp or api, or we .gitignore the folder `apps/notes/content` and users add manually their notes, I prefer second, but if mcp is configured in claude code, we can use the mcp to load the files from the repository
