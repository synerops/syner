# the most important decision of syner

in front of me right now I have to make a hard decision

syner already exists in https://github.com/synerops/syner, but code is dead compared with LLMs superpowers

it takes me nothing to implement and fine tune features, and even though I consider the migration should be smooth, I am starting to see things that constantly makes me wonder if Syner OS should be markdown-based ai system instead of code

I'm scared on this move

Probably need a strategy, I should implement some functionalities, for example:

- use synerops[bot](https://github.com/apps/synerops) to creat PRs autonomously instead of my username
- test vercel sandbox live when syner.dev is deployed

I am not saying this is a complete refactor, instead I believe it's a fresh refresh of the approach (code everything vs llm everything), and probably what I need to deploy on Vercel will be functional agents instead, TODO: that's something to research
