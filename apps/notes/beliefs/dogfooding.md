## What is `dogfooding`

Dogfooding is the practice of using your own product or service to test and improve it. It involves using the product or service in a real-world context to identify and address issues, gather feedback, and make improvements.

## Mastering in `dogfooding`

Is not implicit, you should be creative and clearly understand your needs.

1. Start with small experiments
2. Iterate and learn from feedback
3. Continuously improve and refine your product or service

## How I'm `dogfooding`

Some of my cases where I'm implementing a `dogfooding` approach:

- create new apps using [`/create-syner-app`](../projects/create-syner-app.md) skill, I centralized the stack in documents like: [common-stack.md](../projects/common-stack.md)
