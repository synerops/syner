# Syner Philosophy

## Notes System

- **Personal, free-form**: No enforced schema or structure
- **index.md is optional**: Users define their own organization
- **Context, not data extraction**: Skills read notes for understanding, not for parsing fields
- **No structured metadata**: Don't propose formats like "Language:", "Stack:", etc.

## Skills

- **Suggest, don't enforce**: Skills recommend, users decide
- **Discover, don't configure**: Preferences emerge from notes, not from config files
- **Minimal assumptions**: When unsure, ask the user

## Agents

- **Execute with verification**: Action → Verify → Repeat
- **Fork context when needed**: Isolate complex operations
- **Report back**: Always summarize what was done
