# Syner OS - Foundation Document

## What is Syner OS?

Syner OS is an **Agent Operating System** - a revolutionary platform that transforms how we interact with AI by creating a hierarchical organization of specialized agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities. Think of it as having a personal AI organization at your command.

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem We're Solving
Traditional AI assistants are monolithic - you interact with a single AI that tries to do everything. This approach has limitations:
- **Context overload**: One AI trying to handle all tasks
- **Lack of specialization**: General-purpose AI isn't optimal for specific domains
- **No organizational structure**: No clear hierarchy or role separation
- **Limited scalability**: Hard to extend capabilities without rebuilding

### Our Solution: Agent Organization
Syner OS creates a **supervisor-delegate architecture** where:
- **You** interact only with your **Supervisor** (personal AI assistant)
- **Supervisor** coordinates with **Heads** (department leaders)
- **Heads** manage **Specialists** (domain experts)
- Each agent has a specific role, tools, and capabilities

### Organizational Contract: Schema → Structure → Plan
Every project or workflow in Syner OS follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Schema**: Formal project definition (roles, objectives, outcomes)
2. **Structure**: Which departments/agents participate
3. **Plan**: Execution milestones, deliverables, dependencies, and outcome examples

This transforms the hierarchical structure into a living, scalable organizational system where every task follows a clear organizational contract.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
```
You (User)
└── Supervisor (Your Personal AI Assistant)
    ├── Development Head
    │   ├── Frontend Specialist
    │   ├── Backend Specialist
    │   └── DevOps Specialist
    ├── Security Head
    │   ├── Compliance Specialist
    │   └── Threat Analysis Specialist
    └── Operations Head
        ├── Project Management Specialist
        └── Workflow Specialist
```

### 2. Core Components

#### **Supervisor Agent (Orchestrator)**
- Your personal AI assistant and system orchestrator
- Receives all your instructions
- Breaks down complex tasks into plans following the Schema → Structure → Plan pipeline
- Delegates tasks to appropriate heads (never directly to specialists)
- Consolidates results from heads into final responses
- **Does NOT execute specific tasks** - only coordinates and delegates
- Manages organizational contracts and ensures proper workflow execution

#### **Head Agents**
- Department leaders (Development, Security, Operations, etc.)
- Receive tasks from supervisor
- Select appropriate Actions for task execution
- Assign tasks to their specialists
- Coordinate within their department
- Report back to supervisor

#### **Specialist Agents**
- Domain experts with specific capabilities
- Execute specific tasks using Actions
- Report results to their head
- Have specialized knowledge and Action access

### 3. Communication Flow
```
User Request → Supervisor → Head → (Select Action) → Execute Tool (AI SDK) → Head → Supervisor → User Response
```

### 4. Actions as Organizational Layer
Actions are Syner OS's organizational abstraction over AI SDK Tools:

- **Tool**: AI SDK primitive for agent extensibility (e.g., API calls, external functions)
- **Action**: Syner OS organizational layer that wraps tools with standardized schemas and central registry

This enables:
- **Supervisor and Heads** don't need to know tool implementation details, only what Actions exist
- **Specialists** execute Actions transparently, trusting standardized input/output schemas
- **Future compatibility** with MCP and A2A protocols through standardized Action definitions

## Technical Foundation

### 1. Package-Based Architecture
Each core module is a separate package, enabling:
- **Independent evolution**: Each package can evolve separately
- **MCP compatibility**: Future integration with Model Context Protocol
- **SDK development**: Each package can have its own SDK
- **Documentation**: Independent documentation for each module

### 2. Next.js as Organizational Backbone
- **Dynamic agent discovery**: Agents organized in folder structure
- **Convention-based**: Follows Next.js patterns for scalability
- **File-based configuration**: Each agent has its own `.ts` file
- **Metadata export**: Agents expose their capabilities and configuration

### 3. Schema-Driven Communication
All agent communication follows defined schemas:
- **Agent Identity**: Standardized agent metadata
- **Message Format**: Consistent communication structure
- **Task Delegation**: Structured task assignment
- **Response Format**: Standardized result reporting
- **Organizational Contract**: Schema → Structure → Plan pipeline for all projects

### 4. Persistent Context System
Syner OS features a modular, persistent context system where agents and apps share structured memory:

- **Modular Memory**: Each agent and app maintains its own memory while contributing to the whole
- **Context Preservation**: Users don't lose context when switching between apps
- **Structured History**: Agents can retrieve relevant historical context in a structured format
- **Shared State**: Common context accessible across the entire organization
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of contextual information

### 5. Action-Based System
- **Tool registry**: Centralized action management
- **Dynamic discovery**: Actions can be discovered at runtime
- **MCP compatibility**: Actions can be MCP-compatible
- **Extensibility**: External actions can be integrated
- **Organizational abstraction**: Actions provide semantic capabilities over technical tools

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Agent Discovery
Agents are organized in a folder structure:
```
agents/
├── supervisor.ts          # Your personal assistant
├── development/
│   ├── head.ts           # Development department leader
│   ├── frontend.ts       # Frontend specialist
│   └── backend.ts        # Backend specialist
├── security/
│   ├── head.ts           # Security department leader
│   └── compliance.ts     # Compliance specialist
└── operations/
    ├── head.ts           # Operations department leader
    └── workflows.ts      # Workflow specialist
```

### 2. OS Applications
Built-in applications that extend the OS capabilities:
- **Projects**: Manage complex, multi-step tasks following Schema → Structure → Plan pipeline
- **Workflows**: Create custom automation flows with persistent context
- **Agent Management**: Configure and manage your agent organization
- **System Settings**: Configure OS behavior and persistent context settings

### 3. Extensibility
- **MCP Integration**: Connect external tools and services
- **A2A Protocol**: Future compatibility with Agent-to-Agent protocols
