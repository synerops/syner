# Syner OS - Foundation Document

## What is Syner OS?

Syner OS is an **Agent Operating System** - a revolutionary platform that transforms how we interact with AI by creating a hierarchical organization of specialized agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities. Think of it as having a personal AI organization at your command.

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem We're Solving
Traditional AI assistants are monolithic - you interact with a single AI that tries to do everything. This approach has limitations:
- **Context overload**: One AI trying to handle all tasks
- **Lack of specialization**: General-purpose AI isn't optimal for specific domains
- **No organizational structure**: No clear hierarchy or role separation
- **Limited scalability**: Hard to extend capabilities without rebuilding

### Our Solution: Agent Organization
Syner OS creates a **supervisor-delegate architecture** where:
- **You** interact only with your **Supervisor** (personal AI assistant)
- **Supervisor** coordinates with **Heads** (department leaders)
- **Heads** manage **Specialists** (domain experts)
- Each agent has a specific role, tools, and capabilities

### Organizational Contract: Schema → Structure → Plan
Every project or workflow in Syner OS follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Schema**: Formal project definition (roles, objectives, outcomes)
2. **Structure**: Which departments/agents participate
3. **Plan**: Execution milestones, deliverables, dependencies, and outcome examples

This transforms the hierarchical structure into a living, scalable organizational system where every task follows a clear organizational contract.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
```
You (User)
└── Supervisor (Your Personal AI Assistant)
    ├── Orchestrator Role (Internal Coordination)
    ├── Assistant Role (External Communication)
    └── Heads (Dynamically Discovered Departments)
        ├── [Department A] Head
        │   ├── Specialist 1
        │   ├── Specialist 2
        │   └── Specialist N
        ├── [Department B] Head
        │   ├── Specialist 1
        │   └── Specialist 2
        └── [Department N] Head
            └── Specialist 1
```

> **Note**: Departments and their Heads are discovered dynamically at runtime. The Supervisor doesn't need to know the complete organizational structure in advance.

### 2. Core Components

#### **Agent (Basic Unit)**
- The fundamental building block of Syner OS
- Executes specific tasks based on their capabilities
- Uses tools assigned exclusively to those capabilities
- Maintains local memory/context for execution
- Can collaborate with other agents only when enabled by a superior role
- Each agent has specialized knowledge and domain-specific tools

#### **Supervisor (OS Basic Unit)**
- Supervises the hierarchical structure of the OS
- Can adopt two distinct roles: **Orchestrator** (internal coordination) or **Assistant** (external communication)
- Scope is limited to **departments and their Heads**, never directly to Specialists
- Discovers and coordinates departments (understood as sets of capabilities)
- Delegates **only to Heads**, without visibility of Specialists
- Maintains organizational and hierarchical traceability
- Alternates between Orchestrator and Assistant roles based on context

> **Note**: The Supervisor **does not interpret projects**. Projects correspond to an OS app (Projects), and their relationship with the organizational structure is handled separately.

#### **Head (Domain Unit in OS)**
- Represents and organizes a department in the OS
- Responsible for discovering all Specialists under their domain
- Point of communication with Supervisor for receiving instructions and transmitting outcomes
- Discovers Specialists in their department
- Delegates tasks to Specialists based on their capabilities
- Selects domain tools that correspond to each task
- Validates internal outcomes before sending them to Supervisor
- Reports blocks or risks upward (to Assistant via Supervisor)

#### **Specialist (Granular Execution Unit)**
- Executes concrete tasks within their domain
- Uses tools specific to their capabilities
- Reports direct outcomes to their Head
- Specialized execution of assigned tasks
- Expert handling of tools specific to their domain
- Delivery of verifiable and traceable results
- Adaptation to Head feedback

#### **Orchestrator (Supervisor Role)**
- Coordinates workflow in the OS
- Translates the **Schema → Structure → Action Plan** contract into delegation to Heads
- Controls dependencies and inter-departmental priorities
- Interprets and transforms contracts into coordinated actions
- Delegates to Heads according to the defined structure
- Adjusts plans in real-time based on feedback or HITL (Human in the Loop) decisions
- Maintains global vision of active departments

#### **Assistant (Supervisor Role)**
- The **only voice to the user**
- Receives response schemas (e.g., blocks, risks, scenarios) from Heads through Supervisor
- Translates information into clear language, following communication rules defined by the user (custom scopes)
- Direct and exclusive communication with the user
- Translation of human feedback into instructions for the Orchestrator
- Clear presentation of outcomes, risks, and scenarios
- Application of language and tone rules according to business needs
- Centralization of guardrails to protect internal information

### 3. Communication Flow
```
User Request → Assistant (Supervisor Role) → Orchestrator (Supervisor Role) → Head → Specialist → Head → Orchestrator → Assistant → User Response
```

**Detailed Flow:**
1. **User Request** → **Assistant Role**: User communicates with Assistant (Supervisor's external role)
2. **Assistant** → **Orchestrator Role**: Assistant translates user request into organizational contract
3. **Orchestrator** → **Head**: Orchestrator delegates tasks to appropriate department Heads
4. **Head** → **Specialist**: Head selects and delegates to appropriate Specialists
5. **Specialist** → **Head**: Specialist executes with domain-specific tools and reports back
6. **Head** → **Orchestrator**: Head validates and forwards results to Orchestrator
7. **Orchestrator** → **Assistant**: Orchestrator consolidates results for user presentation
8. **Assistant** → **User Response**: Assistant translates results into clear user communication

### 4. Actions as Organizational Layer
Actions are Syner OS's organizational abstraction over AI SDK Tools:

- **Tool**: AI SDK primitive for agent extensibility (e.g., API calls, external functions)
- **Action**: Syner OS organizational layer that wraps tools with standardized schemas and central registry

This enables:
- **Supervisor and Heads** don't need to know tool implementation details, only what Actions exist
- **Specialists** execute Actions transparently, trusting standardized input/output schemas
- **Future compatibility** with MCP and A2A protocols through standardized Action definitions

## Technical Foundation

### 1. Package-Based Architecture
Each core module is a separate package, enabling:
- **Independent evolution**: Each package can evolve separately
- **MCP compatibility**: Future integration with Model Context Protocol
- **SDK development**: Each package can have its own SDK
- **Documentation**: Independent documentation for each module

### 2. Next.js as Organizational Backbone
- **Dynamic agent discovery**: Agents organized in folder structure
- **Convention-based**: Follows Next.js patterns for scalability
- **File-based configuration**: Each agent has its own `.ts` file
- **Metadata export**: Agents expose their capabilities and configuration

### 3. Schema-Driven Communication
All agent communication follows defined schemas:
- **Agent Identity**: Standardized agent metadata
- **Message Format**: Consistent communication structure
- **Task Delegation**: Structured task assignment
- **Response Format**: Standardized result reporting
- **Organizational Contract**: Schema → Structure → Plan pipeline for all projects

### 4. Persistent Context System
Syner OS features a modular, persistent context system where agents and apps share structured memory:

- **Modular Memory**: Each agent and app maintains its own memory while contributing to the whole
- **Context Preservation**: Users don't lose context when switching between apps
- **Structured History**: Agents can retrieve relevant historical context in a structured format
- **Shared State**: Common context accessible across the entire organization
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of contextual information

### 5. Action-Based System
- **Tool registry**: Centralized action management
- **Dynamic discovery**: Actions can be discovered at runtime
- **MCP compatibility**: Actions can be MCP-compatible
- **Extensibility**: External actions can be integrated
- **Organizational abstraction**: Actions provide semantic capabilities over technical tools

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Agent Discovery
Agents are organized in a folder structure with dynamic discovery:
```
agents/
├── supervisor.ts          # Your personal assistant (Orchestrator + Assistant roles)
├── [department-a]/        # Dynamically discovered departments
│   ├── head.ts           # Department leader
│   ├── specialist-1.ts   # Domain specialist
│   └── specialist-2.ts   # Domain specialist
├── [department-b]/        # Another discovered department
│   ├── head.ts           # Department leader
│   └── specialist-1.ts   # Domain specialist
└── [department-n]/        # Additional departments discovered at runtime
    ├── head.ts           # Department leader
    └── specialist-1.ts   # Domain specialist
```

**Discovery Process:**
- **Supervisor** discovers departments by scanning the file system
- **Heads** discover their Specialists within their department folders
- **No predefined structure** - departments are added dynamically
- **Capabilities-based matching** - tasks are routed based on agent capabilities

### 2. Capabilities and Tools per Agent

Each agent in Syner OS has **specific capabilities** that determine what tasks they can handle and **specialized tools** assigned exclusively to those capabilities:

#### **Capabilities System**
- **Capability Definition**: Each agent declares what they can do (e.g., "code_review", "security_analysis", "data_processing")
- **Task Matching**: Tasks are routed to agents based on required capabilities
- **Domain Specialization**: Capabilities are domain-specific and non-overlapping
- **Dynamic Discovery**: New capabilities are discovered when new agents are added

#### **Tools Independence**
- **Agent-Specific Tools**: Each agent has tools assigned exclusively to their capabilities
- **No Tool Conflicts**: Tools are encapsulated by agent to prevent conflicts
- **Domain Tools**: Tools are specialized for specific domains (e.g., security tools, development tools)
- **Tool Registry**: Centralized registry manages tool availability and access

#### **Example: Security Department**
```
security/
├── head.ts                    # Capabilities: ["security_coordination", "risk_assessment"]
│   └── Tools: ["threat_analyzer", "compliance_checker", "risk_assessor"]
├── red-team/
│   ├── ai_red_team_specialist.ts    # Capabilities: ["offensive_testing", "vulnerability_research"]
│   │   └── Tools: ["attack_simulator", "vulnerability_scanner", "penetration_tester"]
│   └── adversarial_attack_researcher.ts  # Capabilities: ["adversarial_research", "attack_development"]
│       └── Tools: ["adversarial_generator", "attack_framework", "research_tools"]
└── blue-team/
    ├── incident_response_lead.ts     # Capabilities: ["incident_response", "threat_containment"]
    │   └── Tools: ["incident_tracker", "containment_tools", "response_automation"]
    └── ai_firewall_engineer.ts       # Capabilities: ["defensive_monitoring", "firewall_management"]
        └── Tools: ["firewall_config", "monitoring_dashboard", "alert_system"]
```

## Hierarchical Summary

```
Supervisor (OS Basic Unit)
 ├── Orchestrator Role (Internal - coordinates schema → plan)
 ├── Assistant Role (External - communicates with user)
 └── Heads (Dynamically discovered departments)
       ├── Specialists (Capability-based executors)
       ├── Specialists
       └── Specialists

Agents = Basic building blocks with tools specific to their capabilities
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Supervisor** has dual roles: Orchestrator (internal coordination) and Assistant (external communication)
- **Heads** manage departments and discover their Specialists dynamically
- **Specialists** execute tasks with domain-specific tools and capabilities
- **Agents** are the fundamental units with independent tools and capabilities
- **Discovery** is dynamic - no predefined organizational structure
- **Communication** flows through the hierarchy: User ↔ Assistant ↔ Orchestrator ↔ Heads ↔ Specialists
